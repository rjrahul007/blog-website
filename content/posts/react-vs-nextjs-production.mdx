“Should I use React or Next.js?” is a common question — but it’s also the wrong framing.

Next.js is not a replacement for React.
It’s an **opinionated framework built on top of React**.

The real question is: _what problem are you solving?_

---

## Plain React (SPA) — strengths and limits

### Advantages

- full control over architecture
- simple mental model
- flexible backend choices
- excellent for internal tools and dashboards

### Limitations

- SEO requires extra work
- routing and data fetching are manual
- performance optimizations are your responsibility
- code-splitting is easy to get wrong

React shines when:

- SEO is not critical
- you control the runtime environment
- speed of iteration matters more than structure

---

## Next.js — what it adds

Next.js provides:

- file-based routing
- server-side rendering (SSR)
- static generation (SSG)
- API routes
- built-in performance optimizations

These are not “nice to haves” at scale — they become **operational necessities**.

---

## Trade-offs to be aware of

### Pros

- strong defaults
- excellent SEO
- great performance out of the box
- fewer architectural decisions to make

### Cons

- steeper learning curve
- framework constraints
- server/client boundary complexity
- harder mental model for juniors

Next.js gives leverage — but at the cost of flexibility.

---

## Scalability considerations

At scale, Next.js helps with:

- partial rendering
- streaming
- caching strategies
- edge deployments

But scalability also depends on:

- data access patterns
- API design
- caching discipline
- component boundaries

The framework won’t save bad architecture.

---

## Best practices (hard-earned)

- Keep server components **pure**
- Isolate client components aggressively
- Avoid premature optimization
- Treat data fetching as part of architecture
- Don’t fight the framework

If you find yourself “working around” Next.js constantly, reassess your design.

---

## When to choose what

### Choose React (SPA) if:

- SEO doesn’t matter
- app is highly interactive
- backend is fully separate
- you want maximum control

### Choose Next.js if:

- content matters
- SEO is important
- performance is critical
- you want strong conventions

---

## Final thoughts

Frameworks don’t make good products — decisions do.

React gives you freedom.
Next.js gives you structure.

The best teams know **when to trade one for the other**.
